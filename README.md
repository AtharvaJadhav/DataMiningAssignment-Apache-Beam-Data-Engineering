## Assignment Overview
This assignment is divided into three parts:
- Advanced EDA with D3.js: Dive deep into a complex dataset and create compelling visualizations using D3.js.
- Auto EDA with Your Favorite Tool: Use an automated EDA tool of your choice to analyze a dataset from Kaggle.
- Apache Beam in Colab: Demonstrate the power of Apache Beam in a Colab notebook, showcasing its various features.

## Assignment 1: Advanced EDA with D3.js
**Objective:** Perform an exhaustive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a complex dataset from Kaggle using D3.js.
- Pick a complex dataset from Kaggle.
- Use D3.js to create advanced visualizations.
- Push your visualization skills to the limit and get inspired by EDA grandmastery examples.

## Assignment 2: Auto EDA with Your Favorite Tool
**Objective:** Conduct an automated EDA on a Kaggle dataset using a tool of your choice.
- Choose your favorite Kaggle dataset.
- Use an auto EDA tool (e.g., pandas profiler, sweetviz) to analyze the dataset.
- Ensure your analysis is visually appealing and insightful.

## Assignment 3: Apache Beam in Colab
**Objective:** Showcase the capabilities of Apache Beam in a Colab notebook.
- Demonstrate features like composite transform, pipeline IO, triggers, windowing, and ParDo.
- Use BeamML for exercises.
- Be creative in your solution and use the provided hints and resources.
