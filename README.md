## Assignment Overview

This assignment is divided into three parts:

1. **Advanced EDA with D3.js**: Dive deep into a complex dataset and create compelling visualizations using D3.js.
2. **Auto EDA with Your Favorite Tool**: Use an automated EDA tool of your choice to analyze a dataset from Kaggle.
3. **Apache Beam in Colab**: Demonstrate the power of Apache Beam in a Colab notebook, showcasing its various features.

## Assignment 1: Advanced EDA with D3.js

## Objective: Perform an exhaustive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a complex dataset from Kaggle using D3.js.

## Tasks:
- Pick a complex dataset from Kaggle.
- Use D3.js to create advanced visualizations.
- Push your visualization skills to the limit and get inspired by EDA grandmastery examples.

## Assignment 2: Auto EDA with Your Favorite Tool

## Objective : Conduct an automated EDA on a Kaggle dataset using a tool of your choice.

## Tasks:
- Choose your favorite Kaggle dataset.
- Use an auto EDA tool (e.g., pandas profiler, sweetviz) to analyze the dataset.
- Ensure your analysis is visually appealing and insightful.

## Assignment 3: Apache Beam in Colab

## Objective: Showcase the capabilities of Apache Beam in a Colab notebook.

## Tasks:
- Demonstrate features like composite transform, pipeline IO, triggers, windowing, and ParDo.
- Use BeamML for exercises.
- Be creative in your solution and use the provided hints and resources.
